# Financial-Inclusion
Traditionally, access to bank accounts has been regarded as an indicator of financial inclusion. Despite the proliferation of mobile money in Africa, and the growth of innovative fintech solutions, banks still play a pivotal role in facilitating access to financial services. Access to bank accounts enable households to save and make payments while also helping businesses build up their credit-worthiness and improve their access to loans, insurance, and related services. Therefore, access to bank accounts is an essential contributor to long-term economic growth.
